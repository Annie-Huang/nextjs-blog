Advantage of using Next.js
- Next.js does code splitting automatically, so each page only loads what’s necessary for that page.
  This ensures that the homepage loads quickly even if you have hundreds of pages.
- In a production build of Next.js, whenever Link components appear in the browser’s viewport, Next.js automatically
  prefetches the code for the linked page in the background. By the time you click the link, the code for the destination
  page will already be loaded in the background, and the page transition will be near-instant!


If you need to add attributes like, for example, className, add it to the a tag, not to the Link tag.
    <Link href="/">
      <a className="foo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Hello World
      </a>
    </Link>
